Team Members:

Project Description:
The 3 of us are team 2 and we are working on creatting an interactive dashboard of covid cases.

Overview:
First, you will need to **Install dependencies you need for your project:**
We are using Streamlit, a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. 

You need to install the required dependencies in a dedicated Python virtual environment on your machine. For that, nothing more simple, just follow the instruction bellow.
To understand a bit what we are doing, we are using the file requirements.txt to store all the dependencies we wish our environment runs on. This is done to ensure that you will be able to run our dashboard even if we stop updating it.

So, you just need to create and enter your virtual environment :
- Open a terminal and go to the directory of your project repository.
- Inside your project repository, create a virtual environment with the Python venv module:
``` python -m venv env ```
- Now activate your virtual environment:
```source env/bin/activate```
(the command is different on Windows)
- Install dependencies in your virtual environment (activated) with the command:
```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
